# Get start/finish points, e.g. as geocoded points
#install.packages("stplanr")
library ("stplanr")
from = stplanr::geo_code ("Bradford")
to = stplanr::geo_code ("Leeds")

# Obtain bicycle route
# Get your key at https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/apply/
# Put your key in your machine environment using `export CYCLESTREET=your_key_here`
# Route types available are: fastest, quietest, balanced
library ("cyclestreets")
key = Sys.getenv ('CYCLESTREET')
route = cyclestreets::journey (from, to, "balanced")

# Display on map, e.g.
#install.packages("mapview")
#library ("mapview")
#mapview::mapview(route)
```
