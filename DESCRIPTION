Description: The goal of 'cyclestreets' is to provide a simple R interface to the CycleStreets (<https://www.cyclestreets.net/>) cycle routing/data API (<https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/>). This API provides A-B cycle routing, aiming to emulate as closely as possible the routes taken by a knowledgeable cyclist, and as well as other data such as collisions, traffic counts, user-submitted infrastructure images, POIs and more.
